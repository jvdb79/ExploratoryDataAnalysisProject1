This is my repository for project 1 of the Coursera Exploratory Data Analysis course. There are 8 files for the Course Project 1: 4 plots in .png format and 4 R scripts to generate each plot.

To run this script you need to:
Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R) to a directory on your computer
Download the data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;
Extract the data into a directory
Update the scripts to point to the directory containing the data, and the directory to which you would like to save the plots
Run the scripts
